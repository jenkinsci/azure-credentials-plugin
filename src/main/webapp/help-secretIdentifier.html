<div>
    <p>Secret identifier can be found on Azure Portal.</p>

    <p>
        Secret value must be a Base64 encoded PKCS#12 file with content type set to <code>application/x-pkcs12</code>.

        It must also be protected by a non-empty password(both for private key and PFX container) due to restriction of Java security library.

        When uploading to Azure, choose <b>Manual</b> as upload option to avoid password being stripped.
    </p>

    <p>You can convert your certificate to PKCS#12 format using OpenSSL:</p>

    <pre><code>
openssl pkcs12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -export -out cert.pfx
base64 < cert.pfx > cert.pfx.b64
    </code></pre>

    <p>Then you can paste the content of <code>cert.pfx.b64</code> into secret value field on Azure Portal.</p>
